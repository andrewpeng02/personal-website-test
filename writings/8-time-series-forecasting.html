            Time series forecasting is a classical problem in which you predict
            the values in the next timesteps, given historical data.

            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy"
              >M5 Forecasting competition on Kaggle</a
            >
            is an excellent dataset for time series forecasting. The ultimate
            goal of the competition is to predict the sales of a variety of
            products. There are several different files of data included:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              sales_train_validation.csv. Contains a list of items along with
              their respective category, store location, and sales for over 3
              years
            </li>
            <li>
              sell_prices.csv. Contains a list of prices along with the
              corresponding item and date by week.
            </li>
            <li>
              calendar.csv. Used to convert calendar dates to the dates the
              competition uses. Also includes major holidays and "snap" events
              (food stamps).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
          <p>
            I have generated various plots in plot.ly to explore the data
            included.
          </p>
          <iframe

          <p>
            This plots the total number of sales on a given day. The number of
            sales increased over time, with a greater number of sales in the
            summer season.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of the sales come from California, while the number of sales
            from Texas and Wisconsin were roughly the same.
          </p>
          <iframe

          <p>
            Most of the sales were food items, which are much more dependent on
            season than hobbies or household items.

          <p>This is a histogram of how much the prices of items varied.</p>

            This graphs the yearly percent increase in item prices, along with
            USD inflation. The item percent increase generally followed the USD
            inflation, as it should because prices of items are tied to
            inflation of the US dollar.

          <h2>The Model</h2>
          <p>
            To predict the sales figures, I used an LSTM network in Pytorch.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre
              class="line-numbers"
            ><code class="language-python">class M5LSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers):
        super().__init__()
        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim
        self.num_layers = num_layers

        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers=num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)

    # seqs shape [batch_size, timesteps, features]
    # out shape [batch_size * timesteps, 1]
    def forward(self, seqs, hidden): 
        out, hidden = self.lstm(seqs, hidden)
        out = out.reshape(-1, self.hidden_dim)
        out = self.fc(out)
  
        return out, hidden

    def init_hidden(self, batch_size):
        weight = next(self.parameters()).data

        hidden = (weight.new(self.num_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_dim).zero_(),
                  weight.new(self.num_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_dim).zero_())

                  return hidden</code></pre>

              <p>An LSTM model</p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            I passed in the amount of sales and other features like day of week,
            and the model predicts the amount of sales for each day in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>Training the network gave me these results:</p>

          ></iframe>
          <p>
            Loss decreased to about 1.80 over 20 epochs. This is an example
            output of the model:

          ></iframe>
          <p>
            Although peaks of sales are not well represented, the model
            generally followed the true sales amounts. The code is available on
            <a href="https://github.com/andrewpeng02/m5-forecasting">Github</a>.
